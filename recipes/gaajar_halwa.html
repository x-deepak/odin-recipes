    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Served warm, gajar ka halwa (carrot halwa) is a sweet pudding of simmered carrots, milk, sugar, and cardamom.
        There are several types of halwa in South Asia and this carrot halwa is especially popular during both Diwali
        and Eid.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            8 cups shredded carrots
        </li>
        <li>
            8 cups whole milk
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            24 green cardamom pods or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
        </li>
        <li>
            6 tablespoons vegetable oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup dry- roasted pistachio nuts
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine carrots, milk, and sugar in a 6- to 8-qt. Dutch oven; bring to a boil over high heat, stirring
            occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>

            Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin to break open cardamom pods. Coarsely crush seeds,
            discarding the shells. (If using ground cardamom, skip this step.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook half of cardamom until fragrant, about 30
            seconds. Add carrot mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and jammy, about 15 minutes. Remove
            from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in remaining cardamom. Sprinkle with almonds and pistachios just before serving. (Chill in an airtight
            container up to 5 days; freeze up to 3 months.)
        </li>
    </ol>
